I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Southeast University on Dec. 19, 2022. Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. degree from Southeast University in 2016. In the period from Sep. 2019 to May 2023, I studied at UMass Lowell, USA as a visiting scholar. My past work mainly focuses on the permissioned blockchain (especially Hyperledger Fabric). Currently, I am working on application of crypto in blockchain and blockchain user anonymity.
